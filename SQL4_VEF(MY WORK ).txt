-- Question 1:  Write an SQL query to fetch the No of orders order by date along with cumulative count in July 2018  from orders table (date value is based on purchasing time)

with T as(
select
date(O.order_purchase_timestamp) as dates ,
count(O.order_id) as cumulative
from `sqldataset.ecommerce.orders` O
where date(O.order_purchase_timestamp) between '2018-07-01' and '2018-07-31'
group by 1
)
select dates ,
sum(cumulative ) over (order by dates  ) AS cumulative_COUNT
from T ;
--OK
--Có thể ngắn gọn hơn như sau:
/*
SELECT DISTINCT DATE(order_purchase_timestamp) as date, COUNT(order_id) OVER (ORDER BY DATE(order_purchase_timestamp)) as cum_count_orders
FROM `sqldataset.ecommerce.orders`
WHERE DATE(order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN '2018-07-01'AND '2018-07-31'
ORDER BY 1;
*/
 
-- Question 2:  Write an SQL query to fetch the No of sellers order by date along with cumulative count in July 2018 from order_item_profile table (date value is based on shipping limit date)

WITH t AS(
select
DATE( o.shipping_limit_date) AS DATE,
COUNT(DISTINCT o.seller_id) AS COUNT
FROM `sqldataset.ecommerce.order_item_profile` o
WHERE DATE(o.shipping_limit_date) BETWEEN '2018-07-01' AND '2018-07-31'
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
DATE, 
count as seller_count,
SUM(COUNT ) OVER(ORDER BY DATE)  as cumulative_count
FROM t;
--OK


-- Question 3: Find the latest transaction of each seller from order_item_profile (date value is based on shipping limit date)

with T as(
select
*,
dense_rank() over(partition by  O.seller_id order by (O.shipping_limit_date) desc) as rn
from `sqldataset.ecommerce.order_item_profile` O
)
select * from T where rn = 1;
--OK

-- Question 4: Your manage wants to run an A|B test and asks you to pick randomly 20 product id each category from item_profile table for sampling.
-- Suggestion: Use RAND() and ROW_NUMBER ()
with t as(
SELECT 
t.category, t.product_id, 
row_number() over (partition by category order by rand()) as rn
FROM `sqldataset.ecommerce.item_profile`t
)
select * from t where rn <=20;
--OK
